# Tcl proc divide by zero error This repository contains a simple Tcl procedure that demonstrates a potential divide-by-zero error and its solution. The `bug.tcl` file shows the buggy code, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides a corrected version.  The error occurs when the procedure is called with the first argument set to 0. The improved version includes error handling to prevent the error.
